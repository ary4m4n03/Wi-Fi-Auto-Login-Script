# Wi-Fi Auto Login Script (PowerShell)

## Overview
This project automates the login process for Wi-Fi networks that use **captive portals** (webpages that require you to enter credentials before granting internet access).  

Instead of manually opening a browser and signing in each time, the script:

- Detects when you connect to the Wi-Fi network.  
- Parses the login pageâ€™s form fields.  
- Submits the required credentials via PowerShell.  
- Uses **Windows Task Scheduler** to run automatically when the network is detected.  

---

## Features
- Handles session cookies to maintain a valid login session..
- Uses **PowerShell** for HTTP requests and form parsing.
- Bypasses common SSL certificate errors and security pop-ups.
- Mimics browser headers (User-Agent, Referer) to avoid being blocked.
- Configurable for different networks (SSID and login URL).  
- Runs in the background via **Task Scheduler** once setup (no manual execution needed).

## How It Works
1. PowerShell script checks for a network connection.  
2. It fetches the captive portal login page and parses the required form data.  
3. The script submits your credentials to authenticate automatically.  
4. A Windows Task Scheduler trigger runs the script when you connect to the Wi-Fi.
